# deep-learning-challenge
# The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
# With machine learning and neural networks to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
# The deep learning model developed for Alphabet Soup achieved moderate success but fell short of the desired 75% accuracy target with the original model. While the model's accuracy to begin with was close to 73-74%, further optimization and experimentation provided no further improvement.
